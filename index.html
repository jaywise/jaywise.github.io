   <p>For my project, I am aiming to create an interactive, user-facing dashboard summarizing user behavior. The audience will be learners accessing the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/TS62QSNYQ#/screens">PAPO</a> web app, whose purpose is to empower English language learners in Brazil. The dashboard will consist of sliders and radio buttons that in turn morph graphic representations of data in "real time" (no refreshing necessary). For example, a user may be asked, "What is your goal for learning English?" The user will then select the reasons and the "weight" of each reason, e.g., 40% social, 25% professional advancement, 35% entertainment.  </p>
   <p>After each iteration, or learning cycle, with the app, the user will be asked to reflect upon the previously configured learning goals. To extend the above example, users will be prompted to tweak the proportionality of reasons for learning English based upon the most recent learning cycle and their new "station" in life and in the English learning process. </p>
   <p>Finally, the dashboard will be responsive to data collected during the learning cycle of the app, utilizing patterns in user behavior to suggest ways in which learning goals may have changed. Within this culminating, metacognitive phase of each learning cycle, the app will display a tooltip or other light visual intervention when users navigate (scroll or hover) to each graph. The suggestion may sound something like: "We noticed you select learning resources that are more entertainment-minded. Is it possible that your learning goals have changed here? Take a minute to look at your previous goals and tweak them according to how you, as a learner, may have changed." </p>

    <p>After returning from a user testing trip to Brazil, I have a better understanding of the parts of the interface that I can start building out now vs. the parts I will need to wait on. For the moment, I'm focusing on how to gather data for the learner profile dashboard. This means brushing up on HTML form elements (checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) and prototyping a bit in CodePen with D3. My ultimate goal is to make a set of data visualizations that can be manipulated by the user, but which are initially informed by a survey about what kind of learner the user is. The best step for now is to get a handle on how to take data from a <code>form </code>and feed it into a pie graph/bar graph/histogram. I'll wait on the touch interaction later, as I'm not totally sure how to go about setting up touchscreen movements like pinchs or drags to change, say, the proportions in a pie graph.  </p>

   <p>After experimenting with different prototype tools, I decided to just try to find some workable code and tweak it to crudely express a prototype of what a user dashboard could look like. I discovered a library called<i>highcharts</i> that can generate a variety of interactive graphs with less than 50 lines of code each. Pulling some code over from some demos, I created a basic "learner modality" dashboard visualition:</p>

</iframe>
   <p>The arc is not actually interactive at this stage; the values that appear are hard-coded into the JS. So, the next step will be to build the form into a series of values (XML?) that can be fed into the graph. With the arc chart, this would look like generating an arc section for each modality ticked, and then having a way for learners to adjust the proportionality of each learning modality to fit their own learner profile. Ideally, this would be done with tactile, grab and expand motions; but first I have to insert the basic functionality of having the graph values reflect the form values, and be responsive each time those values are adjusted (even after the first "submit", should a learner want to modify his or her response).</p>
