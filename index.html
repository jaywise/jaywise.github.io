   <p>For my project, I am aiming to create an interactive, user-facing dashboard summarizing user behavior. The audience will be learners accessing the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/TS62QSNYQ#/screens">PAPO</a> web app, whose purpose is to empower English language learners in Brazil. The dashboard will consist of sliders and radio buttons that in turn morph graphic representations of data in "real time" (no refreshing necessary). For example, a user may be asked, "What is your goal for learning English?" The user will then select the reasons and the "weight" of each reason, e.g., 40% social, 25% professional advancement, 35% entertainment.  </p>
   <p>After each iteration, or learning cycle, with the app, the user will be asked to reflect upon the previously configured learning goals. To extend the above example, users will be prompted to tweak the proportionality of reasons for learning English based upon the most recent learning cycle and their new "station" in life and in the English learning process. </p>
   <p>Finally, the dashboard will be responsive to data collected during the learning cycle of the app, utilizing patterns in user behavior to suggest ways in which learning goals may have changed. Within this culminating, metacognitive phase of each learning cycle, the app will display a tooltip or other light visual intervention when users navigate (scroll or hover) to each graph. The suggestion may sound something like: "We noticed you select learning resources that are more entertainment-minded. Is it possible that your learning goals have changed here? Take a minute to look at your previous goals and tweak them according to how you, as a learner, may have changed." </p>

    <p>After returning from a user testing trip to Brazil, I have a better understanding of the parts of the interface that I can start building out now vs. the parts I will need to wait on. For the moment, I'm focusing on how to gather data for the learner profile dashboard. This means brushing up on HTML form elements (checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) and prototyping a bit in CodePen with D3. My ultimate goal is to make a set of data visualizations that can be manipulated by the user, but which are initially informed by a survey about what kind of learner the user is. The best step for now is to get a handle on how to take data from a <code>form </code>and feed it into a pie graph/bar graph/histogram. I'll wait on the touch interaction later, as I'm not totally sure how to go about setting up touchscreen movements like pinchs or drags to change, say, the proportions in a pie graph.  </p>

   <p>After experimenting with different prototype tools, I decided to just try to find some workable code and tweak it to crudely express a prototype of what a user dashboard could look like. I discovered a library called<i> highcharts</i> that can generate a variety of interactive graphs with less than 50 lines of code each. Pulling some code over from some demos, I created a basic "learner modality" dashboard visualizaion:</p>
     <iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/jweiss5/embed/WwpErX/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=result' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/jweiss5/pen/WwpErX/'>Meta-cognitive Dashboard  (v0.1)</a> by Josh (<a href='http://codepen.io/jweiss5'>@jweiss5</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
     </iframe>
   <p>The arc is not actually interactive at this stage; the values that appear are hard-coded into the JS. So, the next step will be to build the form into a series of values that can be fed into the graph. With the arc chart, this would look like generating an arc section for each modality ticked, and then having a way for learners to adjust the proportionality of each learning modality to fit their own learner profile. Ideally, this would be done with tactile, grab-and expand-motions. First, however, I have to insert the basic functionality of having the graph values reflect the form values, and be responsive each time those values are adjusted (even after the first "submit", should a learner want to modify his or her response). My plan is to explore <i>highcharts</i> some more, but also look more deeply into the interactive capabilities of <i>d3.js</i></p>

    <p>After working with some D3 tutorials and checking out the API more, I have a stroner understanding of the capabilities of D3 towards building interactive graphs and charts. The baked-in JQuery aspects do make for a conducive set of tools towards my purpose of generating graphical representations of students' meta-cognitive reflections. It have to further investigate how much it affords for manipulating in "real time" both with after-the-submit value tweaks (i.e., "Are you sure your are a 30% visual learner? In your most recent learning cycle, you utilized visual leanring tools more than 70% of the time. Adjust the graph according to your current understanding of who you're becoming as a learner.") and with pinch-and-expand touchscreen interactivity whose data can feed back into the original HTML form elements to reflect "real-time" changes. </p>
    <p>That said, D3 might be a bit of overkill for some basic graphical representations; it is more suited to large, multi-faceted sets of data. I might leverage a simpler library like Highcharts (or even the HTML5 canvas element API, which I have been meaning to dig into more) for more lightweight interactive graphs. D3 could perhaps be better suited for "big picture", cumulative evaluations of learner journeys across multiple meta-cognitive check-in's.</p>
    <p>For the time being, I've played around with proportionality graphs that are readily producible using the Raw D3 graph generator. Here is a sample that maps learning modality proportionality of an individual student (% of visual learning capability vs. interpersonal vs....):</p>

    <p>This week I have been working through the nuances of the "plumbing" (borrowing from Alec's analogy) to pull in information from users and use it to influence the appearance of a page. I had worked a little with event listeners before, but now the scope of interaction is a bit more complex. Whereas before I just wanted to change around formatting when certain things were clicked on or hovered over, I now need to take in relatively complex sets of information from many inputs at once and process that information for the computer, i.e., store it in variables, parse values for later cases, turn values into strings for later use, etc. This requires much more planning than before. With more intricate sets of interactions among parts of the screen, and many events being detected at once (and then replaced by other interactions), I have to really put my ducks in a row before setting down to type stuff out. But I relish the design phase -- from my curriculum design experience, I can somewhat intuitively perform backwards planning and modularization of content.</p>
   <p>More concretely, my goals for the coming week are to develop the algorithm for using range sliders. The idea is to have a set of sliders react to each other; when one slider's value increases, the others' values decrease. It's buggy at the moment, where after a few "slides", one value becomes astronomical...I need to track the values more closely and see where my math goes wrong.</p>
   <p>In addition, I want to understand a little more of how D3.js works so that I can get a handle on its possibilities for processing and visualizing larger sets of data once learners go through a few rounds of meta-cognitive reflection. There is a lot of potential for visualizing data towards making conclusions more obvious/intuitive for teens and other groups of learners that need a bit of a "big picture" zoom out for more profound self-assessment and, thereby, more robust self-awareness.</p>

  <p>To present the process I've undergone over the past few months, I'll probably draw from the visuals I've gathered here in my journal. There have been a few missteps -- focusing on the wrong tool here or taking too long to prototype a new idea there -- but overall the arc of development can be pretty easily tracked via samples of work. I'll highlight my use of highcharts.js for rapid prototyping, D3.js generators I played around with, and various prototypes along the way. Tech-capacity permitting, I'll also include my current version of the slider-based interface.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, my final product vision hasn't evolved much; the idea of a meta-cognitive dashboard still seems a worthy of the significant front-end development time I've put in. I reckon it will be remain an integral piece for the overall app that I'm developing. In fact, now that I understand better how servers and databases tie into the larger schema of app functionality, I've been thinking of ever more ways to expand the interface to make a student's "auto-calibration" of learning goals and modalities as intuitive and collaborative as possible. For example, rather than just giving student the option to "check out this resource that fits your learning profile", I've considered adding a feature to later on check in with learners in order to recommend resources that are as-yet not listed on the app -- essentially a crowd-sourced recommendation engine matching learning types with open educational resources online, leveraging the newly self-aware learners' expertise with a broader set of learning tools than I could ever curate on my own. </p>

<p></p>To bring the whole thing together, here's a further refined, high-fidelity mock-up of the dashboard as I currently see it:
